# Unfinished surface

A protocol for digital spaces has to be used and loved by developers to exist. It needs a small but strong core that enables interoperability while creating minimal friction for developers. It also needs a fluid and unfinished surface so that different applications can adapt to their use cases and create _de facto_ standard that evolves faster than official documentation.

# Examples

- _How Buildings Learn_ contains many examples of buildings well-loved and well-used by multiple generations, and many of them, for example Building 20 at MIT, are simple, sturdy structures that welcome people to modify and participate. A quote from Brian Eno captures it well:

  > Some work invites you into itself by not offering a finished glossy, one-reading-only surface. This is what makes old buildings interesting to me. I think that humans have a taste for things that not only show that they have been through a process of evolution, but which also show they are still a part of one. They are not dead yet.

- Nostr started with a minimal standard that specify how clients send messages to each other through relays. Many important features and considerations are left to the applications to decide, and many practices were codified through [NIP](https://github.com/nostr-protocol/nips/tree/master) after they became common.
- ActivityPub uses [ActivityStreams](https://www.w3.org/TR/activitystreams-core/) to define a common vocabulary that different software can understand, while in practice different projects implement different "flavors" of ActivityPub and use different combinations of other protocols, such as WebFinger.
