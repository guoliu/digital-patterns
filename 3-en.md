# Separation of application and content

Content created by us is not controlled by the application but owned by us instead. In practice, this means we can choose from different applications to view the same content, or we can choose to develop a new application for an existing social network.

## Examples

- Users of ActivityPub, Nostr, AT Protocol, Farcaster, Secure Scuttlebutt, and other open social protocols can all choose from different applications interacting with the same content. However, different ecosystems have different diversity of clients. For example, while Nostr enjoys a wide variety of clients, most AT Protocol users use the Bluesky Social app.
- While Reddit is not built on an open protocol, its users nonetheless expect to own the content they create and to freely choose from the various 3rd party clients built on top of Reddit API. In 2023 Reddit decided to charge for its API usage, effectively shutting down many popular 3rd party clients. Reddit users coordinated a [subreddit blackout](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2023_Reddit_API_controversy#Subreddit_blackout), which did not change the policy of Reddit but added to the decline of Reddit.
- AT protocol refers to this as the separation of "[speech layer and reach layer](https://atproto.com/guides/overview#speech-reach-and-moderation)", where we own our content and enjoy the freedom of speech at the speech layer, where different moderation and discovery mechanism happens on the reach layer.
