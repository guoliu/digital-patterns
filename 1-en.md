# Town square leading to rabbit holes

You arrive at a publicly town square, where visitors and content from various different communities emerge.

When you find something interesting, you can follow the person or the content into a seperate community, with it's own and membership and rule. It gathers a group of people who are interested in a particular topic and forge in-depth discussion surrounding it.

You might feel restricted or offended depend on the vibe of the community, but you can always leave and find a communicates that feels interesting and comfortable.

Instead of showing personalized recommendations, the town square shows the same result for different people, and making it public. We are not trapped in our filter bubbles, but instead can see what everyone else is interested in.

The rabbit holes are communities with their own moderation rules and access policy, supporting finner discussions on specialized topics and deeper connections among smaller groups. The communities can be where our [identities are rooted](https://github.com/guoliu/digital-patterns/issues/2).

# Examples

- Search for a topic in a search engine, and dive deeper into it in a corresponding online community. This experience was more common during the age of internet forums, and now many people have also found that searching in Google with "Reddit" at the end gives more rewarding results and experience.
- In Reddit, Discourse, and many other forums, the current popular posts are ranked on the front page, each leading to the subreddit or category where the post originated.
- In [豆瓣](https://www.douban.com), articles are curated and ranked in [话题广场](https://www.douban.com/gallery/), each leading to the topics (话题) the articles published in.
- In [微博](https://weibo.com/), a real-time rank of topics is presented in [热搜](https://s.weibo.com/top/summary). Users use it as an indicator of attention and popularity of certain topics.
- On Nextdoor, [researchers found](https://tsjournal.org/index.php/jots/article/view/54) that nudging users to continue a conversation in smaller groups encourages more civil conversation. However, the result was [not conclusive](https://www.prosocialdesign.org/library/nudging-conversations-to-groups).
