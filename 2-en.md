# Community-based identity

Our identity is relational, rooted in groups of people and our relationships with them. We have different roles in family, school, work, and local neighborhoods.

The identity in our digital spaces should also allow us to assume various identities in different communities while allowing each community to set its social norms.

# Examples

- In the [Fediverse](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fediverse), instances can "defederate" each other, banning another instance entirely. Most instances host communities, allowing each community to retain a high level of agency in content moderation.
- For most of us, our digital identities exist in different social media. We assume different personas in different applications, from Instagram to LinkedIn. In starting with a new application, we often choose a small group of friends to seed a new social network, which allows us to persevere certain social connections while exploring a new identity.
- Jaron Lanier [argued](https://www.theatlantic.com/technology/archive/2022/05/how-to-fix-twitter-social-media/629951/) that when we can post only as part of a community, we act more civilized and alleviate the need of content moderation.
